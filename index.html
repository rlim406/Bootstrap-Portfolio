        <p>
          <br>Rolanda here! You'll probably find me checking out the latest restaurants featured on blogto or window shopping
          and wishing I had more money. I am pretty adventurous when it comes to food and will try anything as long as it's
          not alive or spicy. I love exploring new restaurants with my friends and family and watch travel/food vlogs in
          my free time. My dream would be to travel the world one day and be able to experience the different cultures and
          cuisines. I have a lot of places to visit on my bucket list but unfortunately that list needs extensive funding.</br>

          <br>Apart from watching travel/food vlogs and eating my way through downtown Toronto, I also enjoy swimming and hiking.
          I guess I have to do something to burn off all those calories. I enjoy exploring new trails and conservation areas
          and like being able to step away from the city life and breathe in some fresh air from time to time.
          </br>

          <br>To leave off on a more serious note, my educational background consists of a Bachelor of Commerce from the University
          of Toronto as well as a Certificate in Business Analysis from UofT. I am also currently enrolled in the Web Development
          Bootcamp at UofT and my goal is to somehow be able to combine all my education and experience and pursue a career
          that I love. </br>
